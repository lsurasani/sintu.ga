        <h4>About me</h4>
        <p>This a short brief hint on how can I started learning computer, and how the situation changed my way. Depending on my experience computer, is developed through everyday activities.
<br>I will get a new point when I spent time on my computer.  During my short period,  or start learning Web-development, everyday practices is necessary.

      <br> I learned a lot of things from try and error, erasing and re-coding, referring to several websites, Google, and youtube videos also help me to improve my skills. For the time being, I become more familiar with a computer. However, I continue to learn to code and programming.</p>

        <h4>"From where...to now!"</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>I never touch any computer until I was graduate high school.</li>
        <li>My first job is the ice-break for me. I had the chance to access a computer, and I started teaching myself the main computer skills.</li>
        <li>When I came to the USA, I joined Georgia Piedmont Technical College to be a computer student.</li>
        <li>After I joined the college, I became more confidential. I like to have a solution when something happens. I'm watching different videos, then I started fixing and troubleshooting something happen in me, my family, and friend's phone, pc, or tablets.</li>
        <li>One of my friends talk to me about web development, and he shows some pages they have lectures about Web Development.</li>
        <li>I took one Program Design and Development course, and I became more interested in programing.</li>
        <li>I begin watching different videos on youtube related to coding, especially, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Googling and refering several websites also my other way to learn more. Still, I'm continuing teaching myself, and I ask help, if I get trauble.</li>
        <li>Hopefully, I will learn more from this class, and my entire goal is to become a web developer.</li>
