        <h4>About me</h4>
        <p>This a short brief hint on how can I started learning computer, and how the situation changed my way. Depending on my experience computer, is developed through everyday activities.
<br>I will get a new point when I spent time on my computer.  During my short period,  or start learning Web-development, everyday practices is necessary.

      <br> I learned a lot of things from debugging,try and error, erasing and re-coding. Taking short-term training, online cources, and referring to several websites(W3School,Udemy, Codecademy, Google, and youtube videos) also help me to improve as well as develope my skills and experience. For the time being, I become more familiar with a computer and web development. However, I continue to learn to more about coding, web development, and programming languages.</p>
